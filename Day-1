1.What is your understanding of Blockchain. 

Block chain is the mixture of distributed database & cryptography technology. 
It is ledger having transaction records which ensures security, transparency & decentralization
Each block refers to the previous block and together make a blockchain. 

2.What is the core problem block chain trying to solve?

Authenticity 
Security
Need of third party trust

3. What are the few features which Blockchain will give you?

Verifiable
Unchangeable
Tamper-Proof
Immutable
transparency
Security

4.What all things does a Blockchain contain?

Current Block Hash
Data Record
Previous Block Hash
Digital Signature
Mining Key
Merkle root
nonce number

5. How is the verifiability of Blockchain is been attained ?

This can be achieved through hashing..
Block 1 :Genesis block - hash 1
Block 2: hash 1 + data = Hash 2
Block 3: hash 2 + data = Hash 3
Block 4: hash 3 + data = hash 4


The copy of the data which is stored in one block is distributed to all other nodes in the blockchain, 
if the data is changed in any of the block, the hash value of that particular block changes and result in different through out the blocks of that partciular node. 
the data can be corrected from verifying with others nodes in the network. in that case the verifiability of the blockchain is achieved.
